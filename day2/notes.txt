- Read all the ranges from the input file (like 11-22, 95-115, etc).
- For each possible number that is made by repeating a sequence of digits exactly two times (like 55, 6464, 123123), check if it falls inside any of the given ranges.
- If it does, add it to the total sum.
- At the end, print the total sum of all such numbers.
